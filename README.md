C++ HTML parser
===============

Simple HTML parser written in C++.

You should know:

- This is NOT fastest HTML parser

- It parses only valid and well-formed HTML documents

Compiles on Windows, Linux and MacOSX (tested with GNU C++, MingW, MS Visual C++ and Borland C++ compiler). Also, can be used in embedded systems (tested with FriendlyARM Mini2440 and Raspberry PI)

That's it.
